### 7. FAQ SECTION

Update all 10 questions:

**Q1:** "What makes SalesAgency.ai different from hiring a sales manager?"
**A:** "Traditional sales managers cost $150K-$300K/year and often lack the systems, training expertise, and network I bring. As your Fractional CRO, you get strategic leadership, elite talent access, proven frameworks (RapidClose™), and AI-backed optimization—all for a fraction of the cost. Plus, I've personally closed $10M+ and trained teams that generated $100M+, so you're getting battle-tested expertise."

**Q2:** "What is the RapidClose™ Method?"
**A:** "RapidClose™ is my proprietary sales framework created in 2021 that makes selling fun, simple, and highly effective. It's been proven to convert better than traditional guru methods because it focuses on Pre-Close Commitment, ethical persuasion, and maximizing Dollar per Lead. It's the foundation of every sales system I build."

**Q3:** "How quickly can I see results?"
**A:** "Most clients see measurable improvements within 30-60 days. My recent case study took a team from $0 to $1M/month in 9 months. Speed depends on your market, offer strength, and implementation pace, but my systems are designed for fast, sustainable scaling."

**Q4:** "Do you only work with high-ticket offers?"
**A:** "While I specialize in high-ticket sales ($3K-$50K+), my frameworks work across price points. The key is having a scalable offer that justifies building a proper sales team. If you're doing $30K+/month and ready to scale, we should talk."

**Q5:** "What's included in the 30-day bootcamp for reps?"
**A:** "Reps go through intensive training covering: sales psychology, objection handling, the RapidClose™ Method, product deep-dives, call simulations, and mindset conditioning. By day 30, they're not just trained—they're elite performers ready to close."

**Q6:** "How does the AI-backed optimization work?"
**A:** "I use AI and analytics to track every call, analyze sentiment, identify objection patterns, and spot script weaknesses. This gives us dollar-level tracking accuracy and lets us fix issues before they cost you serious money. It's like having a data scientist on every call."

**Q7:** "Can you help if my current sales team is underperforming?"
**A:** "Absolutely. I specialize in sales team turnarounds. Through audits, retraining, process fixes, and sometimes strategic replacements, I can transform underperformers into a revenue-generating machine. Many of my best results come from fixing broken teams."

**Q8:** "What industries do you work with?"
**A:** "I work with service-based businesses, coaching/consulting, SaaS, info products, agencies, and e-commerce—anywhere high-ticket sales are involved. If you have a strong offer and want to scale past 7 figures, I can help."

**Q9:** "How involved will you be day-to-day?"
**A:** "As your Fractional CRO, I architect the system, hire/train the team, and provide ongoing strategic oversight. Day-to-day management is handled by the systems and dashboards I build, freeing you to focus on running your business. You get CRO-level strategy without the micromanagement."

**Q10:** "What's the investment to work with you?"
**A:** "Investment varies based on your current revenue, team size, and goals. Most engagements start at $10K/month for Fractional CRO services. This includes system buildout, team training, AI optimization, and strategic leadership. Book a strategy call to get a custom proposal."
